# Date Range Overlap Checker

This is a basic online application that allows users to enter two date ranges and see if they overlap. It provides a user interface in which the user may enter the start and end dates for both ranges and then click a button to check for overlap.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the start and end dates for both date ranges in the provided input fields.
3. Click the "Check Overlap" button to determine if the date ranges overlap.
4. The result will be displayed below the button indicating whether the date ranges overlap or not.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the web page.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the web page.
- JavaScript: Programming language used to implement the date range overlap checking logic.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the user interface for inputting the date ranges and displaying the result.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing the styles and layout for the web page.
- `Script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for checking the overlap of date ranges.
